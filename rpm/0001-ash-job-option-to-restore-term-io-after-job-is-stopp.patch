Subject: [PATCH] ash: job: option to restore term io after job is
 stopped/killed
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This moves the restore IOS support into a build option so it can be
disabled/enabled. Using this fixes lost terminal stdout after using ^C
on programs like /bin/su.
